# Implementing CQRS Architecture with Express.js, Kafka, MongoDB, and MySQL

## Introduction

In modern microservices architectures, adopting patterns that enhance scalability, flexibility, and maintainability is crucial. Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) is one such pattern that separates the concerns of handling commands (write operations) and queries (read operations). In this article, we'll explore implementing CQRS with Express.js, Kafka, MongoDB, and MySQL.

## Technologies Used

- **Express.js:** A web application framework for Node.js, ideal for building APIs.
- **Kafka:** A distributed streaming platform for building real-time data pipelines and streaming applications.
- **MongoDB:** A NoSQL database for the read side, optimized for flexible and scalable data storage.
- **MySQL:** A relational database for the write side, optimized for ACID-compliant transactions.

## Setting Up the Project

### Installing Dependencies

```bash
npm install express kafka-node mongoose mysql
