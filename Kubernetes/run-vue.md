To run your Kubernetes deployment manifest with Kubernetes, you can follow these steps:

1. Save the deployment manifest as a file with the `.yaml` extension, such as `my-vue-app.yaml`.
2. Create a Kubernetes cluster if you don't already have one. You can use a managed Kubernetes service such as Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) or Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), or you can install Kubernetes on your own infrastructure.
3. Copy the deployment manifest file to your Kubernetes cluster. You can use the `kubectl apply` command to do this:

```
kubectl apply -f my-vue-app.yaml
```

This will create a Kubernetes Deployment object that will run one replica of the Vue 3 app container. The container will be exposed on port 80, so you can access the app at `http://<kubernetes-service-ip>:80` in your browser.

4. Verify that the Deployment is running successfully. You can use the `kubectl get deployments` command to do this:

```
kubectl get deployments
```

This will list all of the Deployments in your Kubernetes cluster. You should see a Deployment named `my-vue-app` with the status `Running`.

5. Access the Vue 3 app. To do this, you can use the `kubectl get service` command to get the service IP address for the Deployment:

```
kubectl get service my-vue-app
```

This will list the Service that is associated with the Deployment. You should see a Service named `my-vue-app` with a Service IP address.

You can now access the Vue 3 app at `http://<service-ip>:80` in your browser.

**Additional tips:**

* You can use the `kubectl logs` command to view the logs for the Vue 3 app container.
* You can use the `kubectl scale deployment` command to scale the number of replicas of the Vue 3 app container.
* You can use the `kubectl delete deployment` command to delete the Deployment and all of its associated resources.

I hope this helps!
