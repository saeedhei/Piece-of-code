I'll provide an example in JavaScript using the two-pointer technique to find a pair in a sorted array whose sum is equal to a given target:

```javascript
function findPairWithSum(arr, target) {
    let left = 0;
    let right = arr.length - 1;

    while (left < right) {
        const currentSum = arr[left] + arr[right];

        if (currentSum === target) {
            return [arr[left], arr[right]];
        } else if (currentSum < target) {
            left++;
        } else {
            right--;
        }
    }

    // If no such pair is found
    return null;
}

// Example usage:
const sortedArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9];
const targetSum = 10;

// Measure time complexity
const startTime = Date.now();
const result = findPairWithSum(sortedArray, targetSum);
const endTime = Date.now();
const executionTime = endTime - startTime;

// Measure space complexity
// The space complexity of this algorithm is O(1) since it uses a constant amount of extra space (the left and right pointers).

if (result) {
    console.log(`Pair with sum ${targetSum}: [${result.join(', ')}]`);
} else {
    console.log("No such pair found.");
}

console.log(`Time complexity: O(n)`);
console.log(`Space complexity: O(1)`);
console.log(`Execution time: ${executionTime} milliseconds`);
```

In this example, the `findPairWithSum` function takes a sorted array (`arr`) and a target sum (`target`). It initializes two pointers, `left` and `right`, at the beginning and end of the array, respectively. The function then iterates through the array, adjusting the pointers based on the comparison of the current sum with the target sum. If the current sum is equal to the target, the pair is found and returned; otherwise, the pointers are adjusted accordingly. If no such pair is found, the function returns `null`.
