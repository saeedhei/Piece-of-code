I'll provide an example in JavaScript using the two-pointer technique to find a pair in a sorted array whose sum is equal to a given target:

```javascript
function findPairWithSum(arr, target) {
    let left = 0;
    let right = arr.length - 1;

    while (left < right) {
        const currentSum = arr[left] + arr[right];

        if (currentSum === target) {
            return [arr[left], arr[right]];
        } else if (currentSum < target) {
            left++;
        } else {
            right--;
        }
    }

    // If no such pair is found
    return null;
}

// Example usage:
const sortedArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9];
const targetSum = 10;

// Measure time complexity
const startTime = Date.now();
const result = findPairWithSum(sortedArray, targetSum);
const endTime = Date.now();
const executionTime = endTime - startTime;

// Measure space complexity
// The space complexity of this algorithm is O(1) since it uses a constant amount of extra space (the left and right pointers).

if (result) {
    console.log(`Pair with sum ${targetSum}: [${result.join(', ')}]`);
} else {
    console.log("No such pair found.");
}

console.log(`Time complexity: O(n)`);
console.log(`Space complexity: O(1)`);
console.log(`Execution time: ${executionTime} milliseconds`);
```

In this example, the `findPairWithSum` function takes a sorted array (`arr`) and a target sum (`target`). It initializes two pointers, `left` and `right`, at the beginning and end of the array, respectively. The function then iterates through the array, adjusting the pointers based on the comparison of the current sum with the target sum. If the current sum is equal to the target, the pair is found and returned; otherwise, the pointers are adjusted accordingly. If no such pair is found, the function returns `null`.


**Time Complexity**

The time complexity of the provided code is **O(n)**, where n is the length of the input array. This is because the `while` loop iterates through the entire array in the worst case, comparing each element to its complement in the array to find a pair that sums to the target value.

**Space Complexity**

The space complexity of the provided code is **O(1)**, which means that the amount of memory used by the algorithm remains constant and does not grow with the size of the input array. This is because the algorithm only uses a few constant-sized variables, such as `left` and `right`, to keep track of its progress.

In summary, the provided code has a time complexity of **O(n)** and a space complexity of **O(1)**, indicating that it is an efficient algorithm that can handle large input arrays without consuming excessive memory.
