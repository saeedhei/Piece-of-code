List of common algorithmic techniques or approaches. Here are some commonly used techniques:

1. **[Brute Force:](https://github.com/saeedhei/Piece-of-code/tree/master/algorithm/brute-force)** Trying all possibilities until a solution is found.

2. **Divide and Conquer:** Breaking a problem down into smaller sub-problems, solving them, and combining their solutions.

3. **Dynamic Programming:** Breaking a problem into smaller overlapping sub-problems and solving each sub-problem only once, storing the solutions for reuse.

4. **Greedy Algorithms:** Making locally optimal choices at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum.

5. **Backtracking:** Exploring all possible solutions and "backtracking" when you reach a solution that doesn't meet the criteria.

6. **[Two-Pointer Technique:](https://github.com/saeedhei/Piece-of-code/tree/master/algorithm/Two-Pointer)** Maintaining two pointers to traverse a data structure efficiently, often used with sorted arrays or linked lists.

7. **Sliding Window:** Maintaining a subset (window) of elements in the array or list and efficiently moving or expanding this window.

8. **Binary Search:** Reducing the search space in half at each step, applicable to sorted data.

9. **Hashing:** Using a hash function to map data to indices, providing fast retrieval.

10. **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** Exploring a graph level by level.

11. **Depth-First Search (DFS):** Exploring as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

12. **Topological Sorting:** Ordering the nodes in a directed graph in such a way that for every directed edge (u, v), node u comes before node v.

13. **Union-Find (Disjoint Set):** A data structure that keeps track of a set of elements partitioned into a number of disjoint subsets.

14. **Trie (Prefix Tree):** A tree-like data structure used to store a dynamic set or associative array where the keys are usually strings.

15. **Segment Tree:** A data structure that allows efficient range queries and updates.

16. **Heap (Priority Queue):** A specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property.

17. **Bit Manipulation:** Manipulating individual bits to perform operations efficiently.

18. **Dijkstra's Algorithm:** Finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph.

19. **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm:** Finding the shortest paths between all pairs of nodes in a graph.

20. **Kruskal's Algorithm:** Finding a minimum spanning tree for a connected, weighted graph.

These techniques are foundational in algorithm design, and understanding when to apply each one is crucial in solving a variety of problems efficiently.
